<p>This project follows the continued adventures of Jax's Rangers in X-COM: Enemy Unknown.  I'm still playing the game along side the class in order to keep my stories fresh and organic, and I'm enjoying following their progress through the campaign.  This week, the squad captures a live alien with a stun gun of sorts, which is important for researching the tactics and anatomy of their enemies!  </p>
